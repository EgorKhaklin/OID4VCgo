# Writes a mobile library release's "What's new" as Markdown: the feat,
# fix and perf commits between the commit the previous release was built
# from and this one that touched what the library ships. That's the Go
# code gomobile compiles into it (the OID4VCgo packages mobile/ imports,
# as go list sees them at this commit, tests aside), go.mod and go.sum,
# the platform library's own sources, and its build script, whose flags
# shape the binary: mobile/android/OID4VCWallet and build-aar.sh, or
# mobile/ios/OID4VCWallet and build-xcframework.sh. Demo apps and
# docs-only commits aren't listed. Oldest first.
#
#   mobile/release-notes.sh <previous-commit> <this-commit> android|ios
#
# The commits are Conventional Commits (CONTRIBUTING.md), so their
# headers are fit to list. A header repeated, as release-please's
# multiple-changes form repeats one, is listed once, at its first commit.
#
# A breaking change is one whose header has "!" or whose body has a line
# starting BREAKING CHANGE: or BREAKING-CHANGE:, as release-please reads
# them. Git's trailer parsing can't see that footer: it's a paragraph of
# its own above Co-Authored-By. An app can't call the Go API, so only a
# breaking change to what it can call is listed as breaking: one that
# touches the platform library or mobile/*.go (the gomobile API and its
# ABI). Any other breaking commit is listed with the rest.
#
# Both libraries compile the same Go code, but NFC engagement is
# Android's alone: iOS's list leaves out commits whose header names NFC,
# TNEP or Android, and says how many.
